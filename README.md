## Getting Started

First you would need to create a project in [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and then get the `firebaseconfig` object and add the firebase API keys in the `.env.local` file. Then you can clone the project here and then execute:

```
npm install
```

which would install the NPM packages found in the `package.json`.

Then you can execute:

```
npm run dev
```

which will run the development environment and you can find it in http://localhost:3000
